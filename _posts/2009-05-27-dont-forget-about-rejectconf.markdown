GoRuCo 2009 is three days away, and now's a good time to remind our attendees: You, too, can be a GoRuCo speaker. At the end of the day, we're reserving an hour for RejectConf, so if you have any quick talk you'd like to give, from one minute upwards, make sure to have it ready.

See you on Saturday!
