GoRuCo, a one-day, single-track event in New York City dedicated to everything Ruby,
is now accepting sponsors inquires. This conference will be held on Saturday, May 30th
in the Manhattan campus of Pace University, our hosts for the day.

GoRuCo is headed by leaders in the region's Ruby and Rails community, including founders
of the New York City Ruby user group, and past speakers at the International Ruby
Conference and RailsConf. GoRuCo's sold-out 2007 and 2008 conferences were both highly
acclaimed by both local and visiting Rubyists and this year looks to be just as good.
