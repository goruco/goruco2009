About
=====

The Gotham Ruby Conference (GoRuCo) is a one-day event that will take place in
New York City on Saturday, May 30th. It will be a technical conference aimed at
highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby. You'll spend the
day among Rubyists, Rails developers, and language enthusiasts in New York City,
home of Silicon Alley. The agenda will feature 5-6 speakers and an open session of
lightning talks by attendees.

We'll be starting the day at 9:00 am with registration, and the last talk will
conclude at 6:45 pm. Pace University will be providing the venue. We can accommodate a
wide range of dietary restrictions; if you have any special needs you should contact
us at [info@goruco.com][info]. An afterparty for
attendees will be provided at a local bar later that evening.

Attendance is limited to 150 people and will be opening in April.

If you have any questions, please contact us at [info@goruco.com][info].

GoRuCo is organized by volunteers from [NYC.rb][nyc.rb] and other New York-area rubyists.
