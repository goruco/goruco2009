This year, our standard registration is $150. Standard registration will begin in a week or so, but for now we're only opening registration for our "Friends of GoRuCo".

Friends of GoRuCo is for attendees who want to give us a little extra support. For the higher price of $500, you get:

* Pre-sale access to purchase 1 conference pass
* Recognition in "Friends of GoRuCo" section of program / website
* An invite to attend the Speakers & Organizers dinner on Friday May 29th (location TBD)

[Click here to register as a Friend of GoRuCo](http://goruco2009.eventwax.com/gotham-ruby-conference-2009/register).

Keep in mind that last year's standard registration sold out in three days, so this might be the option for you if you can't imagine life without coming to GoRuCo 2009. If you'd rather wait until we open standard registration, you should probably [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/goruco) to keep up to date.
