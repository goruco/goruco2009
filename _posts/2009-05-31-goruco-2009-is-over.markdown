GoRuCo 2009 is now over. We had a long, action-packed day of mind-boggling presentations and great conversation, but now everything's packed up, some of our out-of-town friends are making their way home, and the organizers are sitting around doing as little as possible.

Thanks goes out to our top-notch speakers, our supportive sponsors, and not least our awesomely smart and friendly attendees, who help make GoRuCo the event it is today.

We will soon be releasing videos of all the talks, by Confreaks, so keep an eye for out for that news if you weren't able to attend this year. And watch this space for 2010: The Year We Make Arepas. See you all soon!
