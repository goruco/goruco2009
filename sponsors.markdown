[![Engine Yard](/images/sponsors/engineyard.png)][engineyard]

Engine Yard focuses on Ruby on Rails application deployments and operations support, so
you can focus on developing your application and business. Customers have started during
development and grown to millions of users without stress along the way. Start with one
slice, grow to 16 slices, then to a dedicated cluster in our data center or yours--all
without changing your code. Engine Yard supports the Ruby community, by sponsoring the
development of Rails, Merb, Rubinius, and other open source projects. We're here 24/7,
by phone, at (866) 518-YARD or email, at [info@engineyard.com](mailto://info@engineyard.com)
